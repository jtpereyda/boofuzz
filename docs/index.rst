Boofuzz is a fork of and the successor to the venerable `Sulley`_ fuzzing
framework. Besides numerous bug fixes, boofuzz aims for extensibility.
The goal: fuzz everything.

Why?
----

Sulley has been the preeminent open source fuzzer for some time, but has
fallen out of maintenance.

Features
--------

Like Sulley, boofuzz incorporates all the critical elements of a fuzzer:

-  Easy and quick data generation.
-  Instrumentation – AKA failure detection.
-  Target reset after failure.
-  Recording of test data.

Unlike Sulley, boofuzz also features:

-  Much easier install experience!
-  Support for arbitrary communications mediums.
-  Built-in support for serial fuzzing, ethernet- and IP-layer, UDP broadcast.
-  Better recording of test data -- consistent, thorough, clear.
-  Test result CSV export.
-  *Extensible* instrumentation/failure detection.
-  Far fewer bugs.

Sulley is affectionately named after the giant teal and purple creature
from Monsters Inc. due to his fuzziness. Boofuzz is likewise named after
the only creature known to have scared Sulley himself: Boo!

Public Protocol Libraries
-------------------------

The following protocol libraries are free and open source, but the implementations are not at all close to full protocol
coverage:

- `boofuzz-ftp`_
- `boofuzz-http`_

If you have an open source boofuzz protocol suite to share, please :ref:`let us know <community>`!
