0.0.1-dev4
==========

Fixes
~~~~~
-  Stopping the target process before restarting is now optional (default is not to stop).
-  Missing property setters in ``boofuzz.request.Request`` now implemented.
-  Unit tests now pass on Windows.
-  Fixed wheel build issue; boofuzz subpackages were missing.

0.0.1-dev3
==========

Fixes
~~~~~
-  Session constructor param ``session_filename`` is now optional.

0.0.1-dev2
==========
New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Now on PyPI! ``pip install boofuzz``
-  API is now centralized so all classes are available at top level
   ``boofuzz.*``

   -  This makes it way easier to use. Everything can be used like
      ``boofuzz.MyClass`` instead of ``boofuzz.my_file.MyClass``.

-  Added ``EzOutletReset`` class to support restarting devices using an
   ezOutlet EZ-11b.

Backwards-incompatible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Target now only takes an ``ITargetConnection``. This separates
   responsibilities and makes our code more flexible with different
   kinds of connections.

Fixes
~~~~~

-  Bugs fixed:

   -  ``helpers.udp_checksum`` was failing with oversized messages.
   -  Missing install requirements.
   -  Grammar and spelling.
   -  ``setup.py`` was previously installing around five mostly unwanted
      packages. Fixed.
   -  Removed deprecated unit tests.
   -  Removed overly broad exception handling in Session.
   -  ``Checksum.render()`` for UDP was not handling dependencies
      properly.

Back-end Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section took the most work. It has the least visible impact, but
all of the refactors enable new features, fixes, and unit tests.

-  Primitives and Blocks:

   -  Created ``IFuzzable`` which properly defines interface for
      ``Block``, ``Request``, and all ``BasePrimitive`` classes.
   -  Made effectively private members actually private.
   -  Eliminated ``exhaust()`` function. It was used only once and was
      primarily a convoluted break statement. Now itâ€™s gone. :)
   -  Split all block and primitive classes into separate files.

-  Many Unit tests added.

Other
~~~~~

-  Continuous integration with Travis is running!
-  Doc organization improvements.
-  Can now install with extras ``[dev]``
