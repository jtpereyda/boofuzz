Changelog
=========

Upcoming
--------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- Rewrote and split the SocketConnection class into individual classes per socket type.

- Added optional timeout and threshold to quit infinite connection retries
- Reworked Monitors, consolidated interface. Breaking change: session no longer has netmon_options and procmon_options.
- `SessionInfo` has had attributes renamed; procmon_results and netmon_results are deprecated and now aliases for monitor_results and monitor_data respectively.
- New `BoofuzzFailure` exception type allows callback methods to signal a failure that should halt the current test case.
- Fixed many bugs in which a failure would not stop the test case evaluation.
- Added `capture_output` option to process monitor to capture target process stderr/stdout .

- Fixed network monitor compatibility with Python 3.

v0.1.6
------
Features

- Handle SSL-related exception. Added `ignore_connection_ssl_errors` session attribute that can
  be set to True to ignore SSL-related error on a test case.
- Fixed `s_from_file` decoding in Python 2 (the encoding parameter is now depreciated).
- Updated documentation of `s_checksum`. It is possible to use a custom algorithm with this block.

v0.1.5
------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- New curses logger class to provide a console gui similar to the webinterface. Use the session option `console_gui` to enable it.
  This has not been tested under Windows!
- Compatibility for Python 3

- When a target fails to respond after restart, boofuzz will now continue to restart instead of crashing.
- New Session option `keep_web_open` to allow analyzing the test results after test completion.
- Process monitor creates new crash file for each run by default.
- Long lines now wrap in web view; longer lines no longer need to be truncated.

- Process monitor in Windows will use `taskkill -F` if `taskkill` fails.

Fixes
^^^^^
- Web server no longer crashes when asked for a non-existing test case.
- EINPROGRESS socket error is now handled while opening a socket (note: this sometimes-transient error motivated the move to retry upon connection failure)

v0.1.4
------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- New Session options `restart_callbacks`, `pre_send_callbacks`, and `post_test_case_callbacks` to hand over custom callback functions.
- New Session option `fuzz_db_keep_only_n_pass_cases`. This allowes saving only n test cases preceding a failure or error to the database.

- Fixed a dependency issue in installation.


v0.1.3
------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- Socket Connections now allow client fuzzing.
- Log only the data actually sent, when sending is truncated. Helps reduce database size, especially when fuzzing layer 2 or 3.
- `Target` `recv` function now accepts a `max_recv_bytes` argument.

Fixes
^^^^^

v0.1.2

    - Cool left & right arrow buttons to move through test case
- New ``Session`` parameter ``receive_data_after_fuzz``. Controls whether to execute a receive step after sending
  fuzz messages. Defaults to False. This significantly speeds up tests in which the target tends not to respond to
  invalid messages.

Fixes
^^^^^
- Text log output would include double titles, e.g. "Test Step: Test Step: ..."

v0.0.13
-------

0.0.7
-----
Features
^^^^^^^^

-  Blocks can now be created and nested using ``with s_block("my-block"):``

Fixes
^^^^^
-  Fixed pydot import error message

0.0.6
-----
Features
^^^^^^^^
-  Added ``Request.original_value()`` function to render the request as if it were not fuzzed.
   This will help enable reuse of a fuzz definition to generate valid requests.
-  ``SocketConnection`` can now send and receive UDP broadcast packets using the ``udp_broadcast`` constructor
   parameter.
-  ``Target.recv()`` now logs an entry before receiving data, in order to help debug receiving issues.

Fixes

   but the maximum value may be too high for systems that set it lower than the maximum possible value, 65507.
-  ``SocketConnection`` class now handles more send and receive errors:  ``ECONNABORTED``, ``ECONNRESET``,
   ``ENETRESET``, and ``ETIMEDOUT``.
-  Fixed setup.py to not include superfluous packages.

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Added two exceptions: ``BoofuzzTargetConnectionReset`` and ``BoofuzzTargetConnectionAborted``.
-  These two exceptions are handled in ``sessions.py`` and may be thrown by any ``ITargetConnection`` implementation.

0.0.5
-----
Fixes
^^^^^

0.0.3
-----
-  Fixed deployment from 0.0.2.
-  Simplify CONTRIBUTING.rst for automated deployment.
-  tox no longer runs entirely as sudo. The sudo has been moved into tox.ini and is more fine-grained.
-  Reduced default ``Session.__init__`` ``restart_sleep_time`` from 5 minutes to 5 seconds.

0.0.2
-----
Continuous deployment with Travis.

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Added build and PyPI badges.
-  Added CONTRIBUTING.rst.
-  check-manifest now runs in automated build.
-  Travis now deploys to PyPI!

0.0.1-dev5
----------
Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Tests now run on tox.
-  Added Google Groups and Twitter link.

0.0.1-dev4
----------

Fixes
^^^^^
-  Missing property setters in ``boofuzz.request.Request`` now implemented.
-  Unit tests now pass on Windows.
-  Fixed wheel build issue; boofuzz subpackages were missing.

0.0.1-dev3
----------

Fixes
^^^^^
-  Session constructor param ``session_filename`` is now optional.

0.0.1-dev2
----------
New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Now on PyPI! ``pip install boofuzz``
-  API is now centralized so all classes are available at top level
   ``boofuzz.*``

   -  This makes it way easier to use. Everything can be used like
      ``boofuzz.MyClass`` instead of ``boofuzz.my_file.MyClass``.

-  Added ``EzOutletReset`` class to support restarting devices using an
   ezOutlet EZ-11b.

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Target now only takes an ``ITargetConnection``. This separates
   responsibilities and makes our code more flexible with different
   kinds of connections.

Fixes
^^^^^

-  Bugs fixed:

   -  ``helpers.udp_checksum`` was failing with oversized messages.
   -  Missing install requirements.
   -  Grammar and spelling.
   -  ``setup.py`` was previously installing around five mostly unwanted
      packages. Fixed.
   -  Removed deprecated unit tests.
   -  Removed overly broad exception handling in Session.
   -  ``Checksum.render()`` for UDP was not handling dependencies
      properly.

Back-end Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section took the most work. It has the least visible impact, but
all of the refactors enable new features, fixes, and unit tests.

-  Primitives and Blocks:

   -  Created ``IFuzzable`` which properly defines interface for
      ``Block``, ``Request``, and all ``BasePrimitive`` classes.
   -  Made effectively private members actually private.
   -  Eliminated ``exhaust()`` function. It was used only once and was
      primarily a convoluted break statement. Now it's gone. :)
   -  Split all block and primitive classes into separate files.

-  Many Unit tests added.

Other
^^^^^

-  Continuous integration with Travis is running!
-  Doc organization improvements.
-  Can now install with extras ``[dev]``
